=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pkginfo> is a package management utility, which displays information
about software packages that are installed on the system or that
reside in a particular directory.

=head1 OPTIONS

This feature is mainly used by L<pkgmk(8)> for creating and comparing
footprints.

=item B<-i>, B<--installed>

List installed packages and their version.

=item B<-l>, B<--list>=I<PKGNAME|FILE>

List files owned by the specified package or contained in file.

=item B<-o>, B<--owner>=I<PATTERN>

List owner(s) of file(s) matching I<PATTERN>, where the pattern is a
regex in L<regex(3)> format.

=item B<-r>, B<--root>=I<DIR>

Specify an alternate root directory.  This should be used if you want
to display information about a package that is installed on a
temporary mounted partition, which is "owned" by another system.  By
using this option you specify which package database to use.

Default: C</>.
