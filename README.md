OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains pkgutils, a set of utilities like pkgadd(1),
pkgrm(8), and pkginfo(1) that are used for managing software packages:
adding, removing and basic information gathering.

This distribution is a fork of CRUX' pkgutils as of commit 9ca0da6
(Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:
- command-line options/usage in GNU style
- manual pages in mdoc(7) format
- split pkgadd(8) manual page into pkgadd(8) and pkgadd.conf(5)
- support zstd packages

See git log for complete/further differences.
