OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains pkgutils, a set of utilities like
pkgadd(1), pkgrm(8), and pkginfo(1) that are used for managing
software packages: adding, removing and basic information
gathering.

This distribution is a fork of CRUX' pkgutils as of commit
9ca0da6 (Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:
- GNU-style options/help/usage
- better GNU Coding Standards support
- manual pages in mdoc(7) format
- split pkgadd(8) manual page into pkgadd(8) and pkgadd.conf(5)
- zstd packages support
- vim syntax highlight for `pkgadd.conf` file

See git log for complete/further differences.
