ABOUT
-----
This directory contains *pkgutils*, a set of utilities like *pkgadd*,
*pkgrm*, and *pkginfo* that are used for managing software packages:
adding, removing and basic information gathering.

This *pkgutils* distribution is a fork of CRUX' *pkgutils* as of
commit 9ca0da6 (Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:
  * parsing arguments with getopt
  * the man pages have been rewritten in POD format
  * the man page pkgadd(8) have been split into 2:
    pkgadd(8) and pkgadd.conf(5)
  * added bash completion
  * build files have been rewritten

See git log for further differences.
