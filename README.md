OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains pkgutils, a set of utilities like pkgadd(1),
pkgrm(8), and pkginfo(1) that are used for managing software packages:
adding, removing and basic information gathering.

This distribution is a fork of CRUX' pkgutils as of commit 9ca0da6
(Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:
- GNU-style command-line options/help/usage
- Manual page in POD format
- Split pkgadd(8) into pkgadd(8) and pkgadd.conf(5)
- Zstd packages support

See git log for complete/further differences.
