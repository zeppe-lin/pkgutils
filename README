OVERVIEW

	This directory contains pkgutils, a set of utilities like pkgadd(1),
	pkgrm(8), and pkginfo(1) that are used for managing software packages:
	adding, removing and basic information gathering.

	This distribution is a fork of CRUX' pkgutils as of commit 9ca0da6
	(Sat Nov 17 2018) with the following differences:

		* added GNU-style long options
		* refactored options parsing
		* the man pages have been rewritten in POD format
		* the man page pkgadd(8) have been split into two: pkgadd(8)
		  and pkgadd.conf(5)
		* added bash completion
		* build files have been rewritten

	See git log for complete/further differences.
