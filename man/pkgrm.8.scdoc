PKGRM(8)

# NAME

pkgrm - uninstall software package

# SYNOPSIS

*pkgrm* [*-Vhv*] [*-r* _rootdir_] _pkgname_

# DESCRIPTION

*pkgrm* is a package management utility, which uninstalls a previously
installed software package.

The options are as follows:

*-r* _rootdir_, *--root*=_rootdir_
	Specify an alternate root directory instead of the default
	'*/*'.

	This should be used if you want to remove a package from a
	temporary mounted partition, which is "owned" by another
	system.  By using this option you not only specify where the
	software is installed, but you also specify which package
	database to use.

*-v*, *--verbose*
	Explain what is being done.

*-V*, *--version*
	Print version and exit.

*-h*, *--help*
	Print help and exit.

# FILES

_/var/lib/pkg/db_
	Database of currently installed packages.

# EXIT STATUS

The *pkgrm* utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
