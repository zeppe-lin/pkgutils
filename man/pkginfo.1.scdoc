PKGINFO(1)

# NAME

pkginfo - display software package information

# SYNOPSIS

*pkginfo* [*-Vh*] [*-r* _rootdir_] \
{*-f* _file_ | *-i* | *-l* <_pkgname_ | _file_> | *-o* _pattern_}

# DESCRIPTION

*pkginfo* is a package management utility, which displays information
about software packages that are installed on the system or that
reside in a particular directory.

The options are as follows:

*-f* _file_, *--footprint*=_file_
	Print footprint for file.

	This feature is mainly used by *pkgmk*(8) to create and
	compare package footprints.

*-i*, *--installed*
	List installed packages and their version.

*-l* <_pkgname_ | _file_>, *--list*=<_pkgname_ | _file_>
	List files owned by the specified package or contained in
	_file_.

*-o* _pattern_, *--owner*=_pattern_
	List owner(s) of file(s) matching _pattern_, where the pattern
	is a regex in *regex*(3) format.

*-r* _rootdir_, *--root*=_rootdir_
	Specify an alternate root directory instead of the default
	'*/*'.

	This should be used if you want to display information about a
	package that is installed on a temporary mounted partition,
	which is "owned" by another system.  By using this option
	you specify which package database to use.

*-V*, *--version*
	Print version and exit.

*-h*, *--help*
	Print help and exit.

*Note*: Options *-f*/*--footprint*, *-i*/*--installed*, *-l*/*--list*,
and *-o*/*--owner* are mutually exclusive.

# FILES

_/var/lib/pkg/db_
	Database of currently installed packages.

# EXIT STATUS

*0* on success, and *>0* if an error occurs.

# SEE ALSO

*pkgadd*(8),
*pkgrm*(8)
