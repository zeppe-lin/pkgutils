//! \brief Implementation of the db_lock class for database locking.
//!
//! This file contains the implementation of the `db_lock` class,
//! which manages locking and unlocking the package database directory
//! using `flock()` system calls.

/*!
 * \brief Constructor for the db_lock class, acquires a lock on the
 *        package database directory.
 * \param root The root directory containing the package database.
 * \param exclusive A boolean indicating whether to acquire an
 *                  exclusive lock (true) or a shared lock (false).
 *                  If false (shared lock requested), a non-blocking
 *                  shared lock is attempted.
 * \throws std::runtime_error If the lock directory cannot be
 *          opened or if locking fails due to system errors, or if a
 *          non-blocking lock fails.
 *
 * \details
 * This constructor attempts to acquire a lock (exclusive or shared)
 * on the package database directory to prevent concurrent access and
 * data corruption. It opens the directory specified by `PKG_DIR`
 * within the `root` directory and uses `flock()` to acquire the
 * requested lock type.
 *
 * If an exclusive lock is requested and cannot be acquired
 * immediately (because another process holds a lock), or if any
 * error occurs during directory opening or locking (excluding
 * `EWOULDBLOCK` for non-blocking lock attempts), a
 * `std::runtime_error` is thrown.
 *
 * If a non-blocking lock is requested (either exclusive or shared)
 * and the lock cannot be acquired immediately (returns
 * `EWOULDBLOCK`), a `std::runtime_error` is thrown with a message
 * indicating that the database is locked by another process.

 * \details
 * This destructor releases the lock acquired by the `db_lock`

 * `flock(LOCK_UN)` to release the lock and `closedir()` to close
 * the directory stream.
 *
 * It's crucial to ensure that `db_lock` objects are properly
 * destroyed to release the lock and allow other processes to
 * access the database.
