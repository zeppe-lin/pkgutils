 * \class db_lock
 * \brief Provides locking mechanism for the package database directory.
 *
 * The `db_lock` class uses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is
 * Initialization) to manage locking of the package database
 * directory.  It acquires a lock in the constructor and releases
 * it in the destructor, ensuring that the database is locked only
 * for the duration of an operation.
 *
 * This class supports both exclusive and shared locks to control
 * access concurrency.
