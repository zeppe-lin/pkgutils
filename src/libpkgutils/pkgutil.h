 * \class pkgutil
 * \brief Provides core package management functionalities.
 *
 * The `pkgutil` class encapsulates the logic for managing software
 * packages. It handles database interactions, package file
 * operations (opening, installing, footprinting), conflict
 * resolution, and system integration tasks like running `ldconfig`.
 *
 * It uses a database to track installed packages and their files,
 * and interacts with libarchive for handling package archive files.
