=item B<-u>, B<--upgrade>

Upgrade/replace package with the same name as I<FILE>.

=item B<-f>, B<--force>

Force installation, overwrite conflicting files.  If the package that
is about to be installed contains files that are already installed
this option will cause all those files to be overwritten.

I<This option should be used with care, preferably not at all>.

=item B<-r>, B<--root>=I<PATH>

Specify alternate installation root (default is C</>).  This should
I<not> be used as a way to install software into e.g. F</usr/local>
instead of F</usr>.  Instead this should be used if you want to
install a package on a temporary mounted partition, which is "owned"
by another system.  By using this option you not only specify where
the software should be installed, but you also specify which package
database to use.

=item B<-V>, B<--verbose>

Explain what is being done.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Print version and exit.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>
